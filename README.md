# ChoEazyCopy, a RoboCopy GUI
Simple and powerful GUI to Microsoft RoboCopy tool
RoboCopy is a powerful tool included in the Microsoft Windows Server that is used to perform more advanced file replication tasks. The biggest benefit you'll find is the ability to create full mirror duplicates of two file structures (including all subdirectories and files, if you choose). RoboCopy also allows you to preserve all of the associated file information, including date and time stamps, security access control lists (ACLs) and more which is missing from normal file copy operations.

For people who like to work with command line, RoboCopy.exe tool as it is comes with package is great enough for them. However for those who are comfortable to work with GUI, here it is EazyCopy, a simple and intuitive GUI tool to RoboCopy command.
